## Memperbaiki Backround Icon Clock
Sudah menambahkan /IconBundles/com.apple.mobiletimer-large.png tapi icon jam tidak berubah

### Non-Live Mode
Non-Live mode is when the clock icon is inside a folder, in Spotlight, Siri, Anemone's preview, etc. This non-live mode may be themed by using the Bundles/ method on the icon itself or with IconBundles.

### Background (Live Mode)
The clock icon background may be themed with Anemone's car support.

### Clock Hands & Dots (Live Mode)
Anemone supports theming the clock hands. As the clock hands images are resized by iOS to fit the original hand size, if you wish to reduce the hand size, we suggest keeping the original PNG the same size and using transparency around your smaller hand.

### Second Hand
The second hand is loaded from "ClockIconSecondHand.png" in SpringBoard's bundle.

### Minute Hand
The minute hand is loaded from "ClockIconMinuteHand.png" in SpringBoard's bundle.

### Hour Hand
The hour hand is loaded from "ClockIconHourHand.png" in SpringBoard's bundle.

### Red Dot
The red dot (the smaller one in the center) is loaded from "ClockIconRedDot.png" in SpringBoard's bundle.

### Black Dot
The black dot (the larger one in the center) is loaded from "ClockIconBlackDot.png" in SpringBoard's bundle.

### Alhamdulillah Selesai
